## Hi there 👋, I’m Bryant!

👨🏻‍🎓 I'm a Mechatronics Engineer with a Master’s degree in Information Science.\
✨ I enjoy bringing together engineering, computing, and data to solve complex problems through a multidisciplinary and technology-driven approach.\
👨🏻‍💻 I'm most comfortable working with data—analyzing it, generating insights, and creating visualizations. However, I also enjoy exploring new areas such as artificial intelligence and game development.\
